When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Because of the size it is sometimes not possible to keep everything at your local computer. 
Moreover when you put it online you can access it from anywhere. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we dont want all the changes to be made public available until andd unless
they are not completely ready for public profile.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Clones is copying between github and locally or both locally. 
Fork is copying from one github account to another github account.
Branches are within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Because then we pull the changes from the remote location and reach a commit stage where both
remote and local changes are stored.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
We could collaborate by asking suggestions via phone or emails and discuss it when meet in person.
This will be really tedious as there might be the possibility when the next person misses the call
or miss an email.
