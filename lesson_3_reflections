When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Because of the size it is sometimes not possible to keep everything at your local computer. 
Moreover when you put it online you can access it from anywhere. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because we dont want all the changes to be made public available until andd unless
they are not completely ready for public profile.
